# News Website (React) - Under Construction

Welcome to my **News Website** project, built using **React**! This is a work-in-progress that I’m excited to share with the developer community. The **frontend** is ready and visually appealing, but it is **not responsive** yet. I’m opening up this project as a **giveaway** to the community for developers to contribute, improve, and use.

## 🚀 **What’s Here**
- A fully functional **News Website UI** built with **React**.
- **Figma design** followed for the layout and styling. 
- The website is designed to be easy to customize and build upon.

## 🌟 **What I’m Looking For**
Since I’m currently busy with work and other commitments, I’m inviting fellow developers to **make this site responsive**, enhance it further, and customize it to their needs. Feel free to contribute in any way you can!

## 💻 **How You Can Contribute**
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Make it responsive** for all screen sizes (this is the key feature I'm looking for).
3. Feel free to **customize** the design or add new features (like news categorization, filtering, etc.).
4. **Open a pull request** when you're done, and I’ll review and merge your changes.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Figma**: Design layout used for the website structure.

## 📂 **Figma Design**
You can find the original Figma design I used to create this project here: https://www.figma.com/design/ZVPOWfyfavYQSvkxdcbDcx/Free-News-%26-Magazine-Figma-Template-%2F-All-pages-(Community)?node-id=1204-8874&node-type=canvas&t=XDb2kmeRst5Wtdnn-0

## 📢 **Why Contribute?**
- This is a great opportunity to practice React, work on responsive design, and contribute to an open-source project.
- Your contributions can help **other developers** use and build upon this project for their own news or media-related websites.
- You will be helping create a **useful resource** for the community, and all contributors will be acknowledged.

## 📜 **License**
This project is open-source and free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. Let’s build something great together!
